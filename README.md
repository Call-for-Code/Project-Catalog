## Call for Code Deployment Framework

A deployment framework incubates projects that are recognized and awarded through the annual Call for Code Global Challenge or one of the Spot Challenges that may arise during the rest of the year. The end goal is to support the top projects from promising innovation until they reach a period of sustainability as open source projects with strong ecosystems of users and contributors.

## Official Call for Code with The Linux Foundation projects

There are fourteen official [Call for Code projects hosted by The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/call-for-code/). This means that they have nearly graduated from the deployment framework pipeline shown above.

Each project at the LF is available for anyone to use and contribute to according to the Apache 2 License and Developer Certificate of Origin. They all have a project charter that defines a leadership team (the Technical Steering Committee), decision making processes, and contribution guidelines.

Since the LF owns the trademark for these projects, they may have two names. One is the neutral project name (such as Pyrrha), the other is the original project name carried forward separately by the creating team or organization (such as Prometeo).

- [OpenTempus](https://github.com/OpenTempus/OpenTempus) provides long-term (annual) weather forecasts for temperature and rainfall in order to help smallholder farmers make better decisions about what to plant and when.

- [OpenHarvest](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/OpenHarvest) is a platform designed to manage farmers, fields, and crops to ensure the farmers succeed in making profits.

- Protecting firefighters' health: [Pyrrha](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform). IoT and AI come together to monitor the levels of toxin exposure for firefighters and to alert them before they are in danger of long-term respiratory problems in this project from Prometeo the CFC 2019 Global Challenge winner.

- Build a mesh network after a natural disaster: [ClusterDuck Protocol](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/ClusterDuck-Protocol) This mobile mesh network of IoT devices based on LoRa can be accessed by people to stay in touch when communication lines go down following a disaster. From Project OWL, the CFC 2018 Global Challenge winner.

- Use AI to make home construction safer: [ISAC-SIMO](https://github.com/ISAC-SIMO) - This project from Build Change uses AI and computer vision to help detect construction issues that could become life-threatening during a major incident like a hurricane or earthquake. This project is an offshoot of PD3R, runner-up in the CFC 2018 Global Challenge.

- Notify communities quickly with Grillo’s simple earthquake early-warning system: [OpenEEW](https://github.com/openeew) - A low-cost IoT sensor measures expected shaking, giving local governments and first responders faster and better earthquake alerts.

- Help small farmers optimize water usage: [Liquid Prep](https://github.com/Liquid-Prep) - This end-to-end solution, originally developed by a team inside of IBM, can help small farmers understand how much water they are using. CFC IBMer Challenge 2019 winner.

- Aerial scout for first responders: [DroneAid](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/DroneAid) - This solution uses machine learning to detect calls for help on the ground placed by those in need. CFC Puerto Rico local winner in 2018.

- Musical collaboration for disconnected performers: [Rend-o-matic](https://github.com/Rend-o-matic) - Helping musicians jam together even when socially distanced, this tool from Choirless analyzes and merges musical waveforms to create a version of a track that can be continually updated. CFC IBMer Challenge 2020 runner up.

- [Call for Code for Racial Justice](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice) - These seven project repositories are in a parallel organization.

  - [Fair Change](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/FairChange). Mobile application to capture incidents and provide information to police officers aimed at avoiding escalation, including a map view to enable search and visualization of incident clusters.

  - [TakeTwo](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/TakeTwo). TakeTwo is an app that aims to reduce racial bias in digital content, whether it is overt or subtle, with a focus on text across news articles, headlines, web pages, blogs, and even code.

  - [Truth Loop](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Truth-Loop). Truth Loop is an app that helps communities simply understand the policies, regulations, and legislation that will impact them the most. Based on these insights, citizens can share their approval, concerns, and/or questions with lawmakers.

  - [Open Sentencing](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Open-Sentencing). The Open Sentencing solution starter helps expose bias and empowers public defenders to address racial disparities in the judicial system directly. We created a tool with the goal of reducing sentencing for people impacted by bias and racism.

  - [Incident Accuracy Reporting System (IARS)](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Incident-Accuracy-Reporting-System). Incident Accuracy Reporting System (IARS) is a Content Management application that addresses the issue of transparency surrounding police incident reporting by allowing witnesses and/or victims to directly submit evidence (images, videos).

  - [Five Fifths Voter](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Five-Fifths-Voter). This web app empowers minorities to exercise their right to vote and ensures their voice is heard by determining optimal voting strategies and limiting suppression issues.

  - [Legit-Info](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Legit-Info). Local legislation can have significant impacts on areas as far-reaching as jobs, the environment, and safety. Legit-Info helps individuals understand the legislation that shapes their lives.

## Contributing to Call for Code open source projects

Each repository contains information on how to use and provide improvements to the project.

- The `LICENSE` file shows source code usage guidelines, most often using the Apache 2 License terms.
- The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file captures the process for reporting problems or sending improvements.
- Together with the _Technical Charter_, these files outline the rules of the road and how decisions are made around technical changes and expectations around effective collaboration.

If you are new to the open source process, philosophy, and tools, we highly recommend that you take the [entry-level, free "Introduction to Open Source" class](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/introduction-to-open-source) from the IBM Developer team which can be completed in about 2-6 hours.
